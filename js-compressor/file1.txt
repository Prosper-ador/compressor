🛑 Where RLE Fails
REFiis not effective for:

Most text documents (natural language is not that repetitive byte-wise)

Images with lots of color variation (e.g., JPEGs)

Audio/Video files (data is highly dynamic and already compressed)

In these cases, RLE might inflate file size!

🔍 You Should Detect File Type or Pattern Suitability First
To avoid worsening compression, implement:

File extension checks

Entropy analysis (see how repetitive the data is)
